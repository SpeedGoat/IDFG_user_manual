# Survival {#surv}

Estimating survival is a complicated process that reflects our inability to directly observe the quantity of interest. One way that we might start thinking about survival is by asking how many animals are alive at the end of some interval given how many started the interval. For example, we might collar 100 deer on the first of the month and then 30 days later we check on each animal and find that 98 deer are still alive. The expectation for survival then is 98/100 or 0.98. This simple expectation only works because the fate of ALL animals was known and every single individual was captured at the same time. This is not what happens in practice. When capture occurs animals are collared over a period of time that can span a few months. If we applied the same simple math as above we would not be very accurate because animals are exposed to risk for different amounts of time. For example, if we collar one deer on January 1 and another on March 1 and we want to know how many live until December we can’t use division because one animal was available to die in several more months. Another wrinkle that often comes into play is collar failure. This essentially causes the animal to leave the sample and complicates estimation.

Sample size is a funny topic in survival modeling because very little information is contained in knowing the animal is alive, but we learn a lot when the animal dies. We basically need to observe lots of death. For example, the estimator above suggested 98/100, which is similar to the [Kaplan-Meier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator#:~:text=The%20Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier%20estimator%2C%20also,amount%20of%20time%20after%20treatment.) estimator (KM). Many agencies use the KM estimator because it is intuitive and relatively simple to implement. However, there are several problems with this approach and they appear at the extremes of sample size. One extreme is the case where 0 animals die, in this case the variance is undefined. Another extreme occurs in almost every study, as time marches on our sample size shrinks and eventually we may only have 10 or 20 animals marked. Let’s say we have a study and only 10 animals are still on the air. If during the winter 4 of the animals die then we arrive at a survival estimate of 6/10 or 0.6. Is this correct? Not likely, not unless you really think that 40% of the population perished. To make this point a little better say we only have 3 animals marked. What are the values of survival that we can estimate? Well, if 0 animals survive we can get 0, ⅓, ⅔ or 3/3. What if the true value of survival was something like 0.85? Turns out you can’t even get that number from a sample size of three. The same is true of coin flips, if you flip a coin three times you can’t get 0.5 the true probability of getting a heads.

With all of the complexities of survival estimation we generally have to write somewhat complicated models to get at the quantities of interest while protecting against bias. The models in PopR use a discrete-time known-fate approach to survival estimation. The models allow the user to estimate by age, sex, space and subset to different time intervals. We have written the models in this way to users to explore a variety of questions, share information among data rich and data poor areas and easily incorporate covariates. A nice example of the models in action is [Regional-scale models for predicting overwinter survival of mule deer](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jwmg.21211) (Hurley et al. 2017). This paper will also give nice descriptions of the math and covariates used in predictions. One point to keep in mind is the idea of sharing information via random effects. The models and results in IPM database mule_deer_shared come from running a statewide model where information is shared among DAUs within a month. This means that the model can use all of the data from the state to figure out what an average, say, March survival should be and then further refine the estimate for any given DAU by also using the DAU specific data. I like to say that the model returns the statewide average when little to no data exist, but gives the opportunity to be different from the statewide average when sufficient data are present. The same DAU specific information can be extracted from these models. For example, if you want to know survival in March of 2019 in the Beaverhead DAU that information is available. The last feature of survival models that I will discuss are the multi-state models. These models allow the user to estimate not only survival, but the probability of death by harvest or death by some other cause. One equation to keep in mind here is Survival + Mortality = 1. This is always true and must be true. If 30% of the population is harvested in a given year then the maximum value of survival is 0.7 if we assume that no animals died of any other cause. In fact, this equation is part of the reason why we care about abundance because the survival rate or harvest mortality rate can be applied to the abundance to determine the number of animals that died in a given year. Anyway, using the multi-state models the software will report Survival, Harvest Mortality and Other Mortality. Remember that if you are conditioned to seeing survival with harvest removed then survival is equal to 1 - other mortality. For example, I expect adult female mule deer survival to be about 0.85 in the absence of harvest and I might get that value if I censor harvest in the known fate model. However, because survival + harvest mortality + other mortality = 1 the survival from the multi-state model will be lower. If we rearrange the above equation to solve for survival + harvest than we will probably get a number like 0.85 from 1 - other mortality = survival + harvest mortality, which is essentially the probability of surviving non-harvest causes of death.

## Running a Survival Model {#surv-model}

### Loading Data {#surv-load}

To run a survival model select **Survival** in the sidebar then click **Setup**. Select a species and [DAU](#gl-dau) on the Overview tab and click the <span style="color: #3c8dbc;"><b>Download Data</b></span> button to download data from the [IDFG database](#gl-samm). Once the download is complete a dialog will confirm that the data has been downloaded and alert you to any errors present in the data (see the [errors](#surv-errors) section). Data will only be read for the species and DAU selected, so if you switch either selection later you'll have to repeat the process.

Once the data is downloaded you can review it in various formats in the pane to the right. Data is pulled from [SAMM](#gl-samm), so if you find individuals that plot out in the wrong area or DAU, you’ll need to fix them there.

* Captures: Shows a map of the capture locations of all the individuals used in the analysis. The table on the left shows any IDs that have bad or missing capture location information.
* Mortalities: Shows a map of the mortality locations for the DAU. The table on the left shows any IDs that have bad or missing mortality location information.
* Collared Animals: Shows a barplot of the number of collared individuals throughout the analysis years. You can hover over each bar with your mouse and at the top of the graph, it will show you the status of collared individuals by month. Categories include missing, other mortality, harvested, and alive.
* Raw Data Summary: Shows a summary of the raw data available to be for the selected DAU.
  
All the data available for the selected DAU can be viewed using the Captures, Monitoring, Mortalities, Encounter Histories, and Raw Data tabs in the bottom table. The Captures and Mortalities tables show information for *all* individuals, even if capture/mortality information is unavailable. You can sort using the arrows next to the headings and filter by entering names/values into the boxes under the headings.

You can also view the data loaded from SADD on the **Individuals** page, where you can view raw data, encounter histories, captures, and mortality records. You can also filter to a specific animal, which can be helpful in tracking down [errors](#surv-errors).

### Model Options {#surv-options}

After loading survival data for a particular species and DAU move on to the Subset tab to specify the parameters for your model. Select a sex (default is all) and [age class](#gl-age-classes) (default is adult) to model, then select the range of years to include in the analysis (default includes all data available).

Move on to the Structure tab and use the inputs to define the model that will be run on your data. First select a [known fate](#gl-known-fate) (simple survival estimation) or [multi-state](#gl-multi-state) (estimate mortality rates by cause - currently unavailable) model. If you're running a multi-state model use the Censor Fate input to exclude a particular source of mortality from the analysis. For example, if harvest is selected the estimated survival will answer the question “What would survival be in the absence of harvest?” Finally define how survival is allowed to vary with sex, time, and space. You must select more than 5 years for analysis to model survival as varying through time, and modeling survival as spatially varying is only available for statewide models.

If you plan on adding your results to an [IPM dataset](#gl-ipm-db) you should use the default settings:

* Sex: All
* Age: One at a time, A then J
* Analysis Years: 2000-Current Year
* Model Type: Known Fate
* Covariates: None
* Censor Fate(s): Harvest
* Model sexes as: Different
* Model time as: Monthly
* Model space as: Varying
* Thinning Rate: 1
* Burnin Length: 35,000
* MCMC Iterations: 25,000

When you've loaded your data, selected the appropriate options, and defined your model structure, move on to the Run tab, specify your [MCMC settings](#gl-mcmc), and click <span style="color: #3c8dbc;"><b>Fit Model</b></span> to run the model. If no errors are encountered dismiss the dialog and click **Tables** in the sidebar to view your results. If the model fails to run check the [errors](#surv-errors) section.

### Model Output {#surv-output}

Results are viewed under the **Tables** subheading on the left under **Survival**.  Estimates can be viewed by year or by month. Mean estimates are accompanied by the standard deviation as well as the lower and upper confidence intervals. You can copy, print, or download the data using the buttons at the top right of the table. You can also sort and filter using the boxes below the column headings.

### Adding Results to IPM {#surv-admin}

Use the **Admin** page to add the results of your survival model to the input data for the IPM. Only add the results to an [IPM dataset](#gl-ipm-db) if you're sure you used the correct settings and data. If there is already survival data in the IPM data file you select for the same species, year, and unit, that data will be overwritten with the results of your current model.

Select the [IPM dataset](#gl-ipm-db) to which you want to add your estimates, and verify that the estimates themselves look reasonable, then click <span style="color: #dd4b39;"><b>Update DB</b></span> to add the estimates to the database file. DO NOT add results to the IPM database if you didn't use the default settings outlined in the [Model Options]{#surv-options} section.
