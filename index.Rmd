# Introduction

This manual is a support document for the IDFG PopR website. The PopR website streamlines the processes of dataentry to analysis by allowing the user to enter [data](#de) and fit models in one location. Users can fit [integrated population models](#ipm), [sightability models](#sight), and [survival models](#surv) using the PopR interface.

Each tool has its own chapter, which includes an Overview, a Walkthrough, and a reference page for each tab. The Overview gives a general description of what a tool is and how it works, as well as use cases for the tool. The Walkthrough is a step-by-step guide which explains how to load data and generate analyses with each tool. The reference page gives a more detailed explanation of each page, as well as how to navigate the various menus.
