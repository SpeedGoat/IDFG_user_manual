["surv-model.html", "2.1 Running a Survival Model", " 2.1 Running a Survival Model 2.1.1 Loading Data To run a survival model select Survival in the sidebar then click Setup. Select a species and DAU on the Overview tab and click the Download Data button to download data from the IDFG database. Once the download is complete a dialog will confirm that the data has been downloaded and alert you to any errors present in the data (see the errors section). Data will only be read for the species and DAU selected, so if you switch either selection later you’ll have to repeat the process. Once the data is downloaded you can review it in various formats in the pane to the right. Data is pulled from SADD, so if you find individuals that plot out in the wrong area or DAU, you’ll need to fix them there. Captures: Shows a map of the capture locations of all the individuals used in the analysis. The table on the left shows any IDs that have bad or missing capture location information. Mortalities: Shows a map of the mortality locations for the DAU. The table on the left shows any IDs that have bad or missing mortality location information. Collared Animals: Shows a barplot of the number of collared individuals throughout the analysis years. You can hover over each bar with your mouse and at the top of the graph, it will show you the status of collared individuals by month. Categories include missing, other mortality, harvested, and alive. Raw Data Summary: Shows a summary of the raw data available to be for the selected DAU. All the data available for the selected DAU can be viewed using the Captures, Monitoring, Mortalities, Encounter Histories, and Raw Data tabs in the bottom table. The Captures and Mortalities tables show information for all individuals, even if capture/mortality information is unavailable. You can sort using the arrows next to the headings and filter by entering names/values into the boxes under the headings. You can also view the data loaded from SADD on the Individuals page, where you can view raw data, encounter histories, captures, and mortality records. You can also filter to a specific animal, which can be helpful in tracking down errors. 2.1.2 Model Options After loading survival data for a particular species and DAU move on to the Subset tab to specify the parameters for your model. Select a sex (default is all) and age class (default is adult) to model, then select the range of years to include in the analysis (default includes all data available). Move on to the Structure tab and use the inputs to define the model that will be run on your data. First select a known fate (simple survival estimation) or multi-state (estimate mortality rates by cause - currently unavailable) model. If you’re running a multi-state model use the Censor Fate input to exclude a particular source of mortality from the analysis. For example, if harvest is selected the estimated survival will answer the question “What would survival be in the absence of harvest?” Finally define how survival is allowed to vary with sex, time, and space. You must select more than 5 years for analysis to model survival as varying through time, and modeling survival as spatially varying is only available for statewide models. If you plan on adding your results to an IPM dataset you should use the default settings: Sex: All Age: One at a time, A then J Analysis Years: 2000-Current Year Model Type: Known Fate Covariates: None Censor Fate(s): Harvest Model sexes as: Different Model time as: Monthly Model space as: Varying Thinning Rate: 1 Burnin Length: 35,000 MCMC Iterations: 25,000 When you’ve loaded your data, selected the appropriate options, and defined your model structure, move on to the Run tab, specify your MCMC settings, and click Fit Model to run the model. If no errors are encountered dismiss the dialog and click Tables in the sidebar to view your results. If the model fails to run check the errors section. 2.1.3 Model Output Results are viewed under the Tables subheading on the left under Survival. Estimates can be viewed by year or by month. Mean estimates are accompanied by the standard deviation as well as the lower and upper confidence intervals. You can copy, print, or download the data using the buttons at the top right of the table. You can also sort and filter using the boxes below the column headings. 2.1.4 Adding Results to IPM Use the Admin page to add the results of your survival model to the input data for the IPM. Only add the results to an IPM dataset if you’re sure you used the correct settings and data. If there is already survival data in the IPM data file you select for the same species, year, and unit, that data will be overwritten with the results of your current model. Select the IPM dataset to which you want to add your estimates, and verify that the estimates themselves look reasonable, then click Update DB to add the estimates to the database file. DO NOT add results to the IPM database if you didn’t use the default settings outlined in the Model Options section. 2.1.5 Errors "],

["sight.html", "3 Sightability", " 3 Sightability Sightability models use aerial survey data combined with detection probability models to estimate total abundance within a sampling unit. The basic idea behind sightability is a fairly simple process. First the sightability of the group is estimated by taking the covariate values and previously estimated coefficients. For example, if the model had one covariate called veg and the value of veg for a given observation was .8 then we can estimate sightability with something like: \\(logit(sight) = 1.1 - 0.6 * veg\\) Here the average sightability is something like logit(1.1) or 0.75 and the effect of veg is roughly -0.6, so if we plug in our observation of 0.8 we would get \\(logit(sight) = 1.1 - 0.6 * 0.8\\) The value of sight is then 0.65. Now let’s say that the group had 10 animals that were observed from aircraft. The estimate for the group size is 10/0.65 or about 15 animals. That is the adjustment applied to each group. To conduct a sightability survey a manager would first define the desired scope of inference, say a DAU. Within the DAU there are GMUs and subunits. The area is then stratified based on previous observations and snow cover. For the sake of an example let’s say we have 100 subunits and we have decided that 60 are in the high stratum, 30 are in the medium and 10 are in low. Within each stratum we have to decide how many to sample. If we decide to sample all of the highs and half of the lows and a quarter of the lows then we will have 60 high, 15 medium and say 3 low subunits to fly. With data in hand we can estimate sightability as outlined above and then we will extrapolate those numbers to all of the areas that were not sampled. For simplicity, say our sightability adjusted estimates for each stratum were 250, 75 and 10 for high, medium and low respectively. The general idea behind extrapolating is straightforward. To know what area was we simply divide the number of subunits flown by the population of subunits within a stratum. High: 60/60 = 1 Medium: 15/30 = 0.5 Low: 3/10 = 0.333 Now to use this number we will divide the adjusted number of animals by the proportion of subunits flown High: 250/1 = 250 animals Medium: 75/0.5 = 150 animals Low: 10/0.333 = 30 animals This example hopefully shows the importance of sampling and how critical it is to know what stratum an observation came from. Without the stratum we cannot know the proportion of the area sampled and cannot make an estimate relate back to the population of subunits. The extrapolation step also demonstrates that the density of animals is assumed to be constant. In the case of the mediums the area sampled produced 75 animals and it is assumed that the unflown subunits with the medium stratum are the same, which is how we get away with dividing by the proportion of area sampled. If a biologist only flies subunits where they know there are lots of deer then that number will be extrapolated to the remainder of the GMU and DAU. "],
["sight-de.html", "3.1 Sightability Data Entry", " 3.1 Sightability Data Entry 3.1.1 GPS Data Entry The first step in entering sightability data is to upload GPS data for your survey (if you don’t have a .csv file containing GPS data for your survey you can skip this step). Click Sightability in the sidebar, then GPS Data Entry. Use the Browse button to select the GPS file on your computer, and the data from the file will appear on the map and in the table to the right. Review the data in both the map and the table to ensure that everything is accurate. If corrections need to be made open the file on your computer, make the necessary changes, and use the Browse button to upload the file again. Once everything in the Map and Table panes is correct, click the Write to DB button to save the data to the server. 3.1.2 Metadata Entry The next step is to enter the metadata for your survey. Click Metadata Entry in the sidebar under Sightability, then select the species and survey type. Enter the date the survey took place, the type of aircraft used, and the number of observations (rows) recorded on the datasheet. Select the region and analysis unit, and if you uploaded a file in the previous step select it in the GPS Data File input. Enter the number of subunits sampled in each density stratum, and finally enter any comments or notes about the survey. Once the form is complete click the Submit Response button to continue. A dialog will appear confirming that the data were saved. If you made a mistake on the Metadata form you can correct it on the Past Surveys tab. This tab presents a spreadsheet with all of the survey metadata entered to date. You can delete rows by right-clicking or edit the information in any of the fields. If you make changes on the Past Surveys tab make sure to click the Save Edits button when you’re finished. 3.1.3 Observation Entry Once the Metadata is entered correctly click Observation Entry on the sidebar, then click the Load button to get started. Use the inputs in the dialog that appears to select the survey you entered in the previous step, then click Load Data. A spreadsheet will appear with the Species, Survey Type, Date, and Area populated for you. Fill in the additional columns (beginning with Stratum) with the information from your datasheet. You may need to use the horizontal scroll bar below the spreadsheet to access all the columns if they don’t fit on your screen. The number of rows available in the spreadsheet will match the number of observations you entered in the Metadata from, but If you need to add additional rows you can do so by right-clicking in the last row and selecting “insert row below.” You can view a summary of the data you’ve entered below the spreadsheet. Once all the data from your datasheet has been added to the spreadsheet click Validate to check for errors. If any errors are present a dialog will appear explaining what they are and how to fix them. Once any errors are corrected use the Save button to save the data to the server. "],

Data will only be read for the species and DAU selected, so if you switch either selection later you’ll have to repeat the process. Once the data is downloaded you can review it in various formats in the pane to the right. Flight record: Summarizes the data downloaded by survey type and bio year. Sampling: Summarizes the data downloaded by stratum, showing the population of units available and how many of those were sampled. This is a great table to check against your expectations - how many high, medium and low subunits did you fly? Does the data match? This is also a good place to make sure the stratum and unit were entered correctly for all of your observations - missing values in those columns are a common cause of errors. All Data: Shows all of the observation data downloaded for this species and DAU. Data to Model: Shows the observation data as it will be passed to the model for transparency. If any errors appear in the data you can correct them through the Metadata Entry or Observation Entry pages in the sidebar. If you make any corrections be sure to load the data again when you return to the Setup page. 3.2.2 Model Options After loading sightability data for a particular species and DAU move on to the Options tab to specify the parameters for your model. Select a year from those available in the data, then choose whether to analyze by area, unit, stratum, or sub-unit. It’s important to note that your results cannot be used to extrapolate to a wider geographic area if you select unit, stratum, or subunit in this dropdown. Finally select a survey type and aircraft - the available selections for these may be limited based on the species selected. Move on to the Sampling tab and review the values displayed. These values are taken from the data entered for the survey you selected. Subunits represent subdivisions within a stratum, so the minimum number of subunits in any given stratum is 1. If there are subunits within a stratum that weren’t sampled you may need to adjust the numbers here to accurately represent the proportion sampled. When you’ve selected the appropriate options and adjusted the sampling parameters (if necessary) move on to the Run tab and click Fit Model to run the model. If no errors are encountered dismiss the dialog and click Tables in the sidebar to view your results. If the model fails to run check the errors section. 3.2.3 Model Output Once you’ve run a model you can view the results on the Tables page. The top half of the page shows the data used in the model, summarized by category: Sample: Displays how many subunits were available in each stratum, and how many of those were sampled. Activity: Displays the number of observations for each activity category. Vegetation: Displays the number of observations for each vegetation type. Snow: Displays the number of observations binned by snow cover. Group Size: Displays the number of observations binned by group size. The bottom half of the page shows the model output: Detection: Displays the probability of detection (as a range) assigned to the input observations. N: Displays the abundance estimates produced by the model by demographic, including the variance for each estimate. 3.2.4 Adding Results to IPM Use the Admin page to add the results of your sightability model to the input data for the IPM. Only add the results to an IPM dataset if you’re sure you used the correct settings and data. If there is already sightability data in the IPM data file you select for the same year and unit, that data will be overwritten with the results of your current model. If you ran a model on composition survey data, sex and age ratios will be added; for sightability surveys abundance estimates will be added. Select the IPM dataset to which you want to add your estimates, and verify that the estimates themselves look reasonable, then click Update DB to add the estimates to the database file. 3.2.5 Errors Missing values in the stratum or unit fields These errors should be apparent when reviewing the data in the Sampling tab of the Setup page. Missing values in these columns can cause data to be discarded or cause the model to fail. To fix them navigate to the Observation Entry page, load the data for the survey in question, and fill in the missing information. Don’t forget to click the button to save your changes when all the values have been entered. Empty rows at the bottom of the observation table Sometimes when the metadata and observations entered for a survey don’t agree there can be empty rows at the bottom of the observation data entry table. If that happens load the survey data in the Observation Entry page and right-click on the empty row(s) to delete. As above, don’t forget to save your changes. "],

["ipm-model.html", "4.1 Running the IPM", " 4.1 Running the IPM 4.1.1 Loading Data To run an integrated population model select IPM in the sidebar then click Setup. Running an IPM requires 2 types of data: population estimates from an IPM database and harvest data from the IDFG database. Start by selecting a species and DAU on the Overview tab, then select the IPM database you want to use and choose how the model incorporates future weather. At this point you can review the population estimates from previous models in the plots to the right and the tables along the bottom, but notice that there is no data available in the Harvest tabs. To fix that click the Fetch Harvest Data button to download the appropriate data from the IDFG database. Once the download is complete a dialog will confirm that the data has been downloaded and alert you to any errors present in the data (see the errors section). Now you can review the harvest data in the plots and tables in addition to the population estimates. Data will only be read for the species and DAU selected, so if you switch either selection later you’ll have to download harvest data again. Once you’ve loaded estimates from the IPM database and downloaded harvest data from SADD you can review everything in the plots to the right and tables below. All data available to the IPM for analysis is shown in these panes. If you cannot find data that should be used by the IPM for analysis in either of these areas then that data has not been made available to the model. This may indicate that the missing data needs to be passed to the IPM via the sightability or survival tabs. 4.1.2 Model Options After loading data for a particular species and DAU move on to the Structure tab and use the inputs to define the model that will be run on your data. Use the inputs to define whether the model uses population reconstruction and whether reproduction and survival vary by year or remain constant. If you want to run the IPM with default settings for the current species click the Default Structure button below the inputs to load the default settings listed here: Use Population Reconstruction: No Reproduction: Time Varying Juvenile Survival: Time Varying Subadult Survival: Constant (elk only) Adult Survival: Constant If the IPM doesn’t run or produces poor results with these defaults you can try adjusting the settings to better match the available data, but keep in mind that at least one of the variables must be constant (rather than time varying) for the IPM to work. The harvest tab allows you to predict future harvest rates and incorporate those predictions into the IPM. First use the slider at the top to select the range of years for which you want to estimate abundance. If your selected range extends beyond the available harvest data use the additional sliders to specify how many animals you expect to be harvested by sex. You can use the Options button to set the sliders to the min, mean, median, or max from the existing harvest data, or to use the most recent data available (last). You can also click Reset to return to the default (mean) values. Be sure to click on the Harvest tab to the right to preview how your settings will be passed into the IPM. When you’ve loaded your data, defined your model structure, and provided future harvest estimates (if needed), move on to the Run tab, specify your MCMC settings, and click Fit Model to run the IPM. If no errors are encountered dismiss the dialog and click Tables in the sidebar to view your results. If the model fails to run check the errors section. 4.1.3 Model Output Results are viewed under the Plots and Tables subheadings on the left under IPM. On the tables tab you can view all of the abundance estimates by year, age class, and sex. The mean estimate, standard deviation, and confidence intervals are reported, along with the BGR diagnostic in the Rhat column. Values greater than 1.1 in this column indicate poor model fit, in which case you may want to adjust the model structure or MCMC settings. Values at or near 1, on the other hand, indicate the model fit the data well. The Plots page shows the estimates plotted over time. Plots are grouped into 4 categories based on the population parameter displayed: Abundance Total abundance Female abundance by age class Male abundance by age class Ratios Age ratio (young per adult female) Sex ratio (adult male per adult female) Survival Female survival by age class Male survival by age class Misc Growth Rate (λ) Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY - shows how growth rate, recruitment, and juvenile survival vary with total abundance) Harvest Rate by sex Harvest by sex All plots have tools along the right side which allow the user to zoom in on different sections of the graph, hover over specific points to get detailed information, and save/download as an image file.

["gl-general.html", "5.1 General", " 5.1 General Age Classes Age classes must be defined for each species to capture variability in parameters like survival and harvest rate, as well as to determine when animals begin to reproduce. Regardless of actual birth date animals transition to the next age class on December 15, the model anniversary used in the IPM. Assuming calves and fawns are born approximately mid-June each year, the age classes translate to roughly the following: Mule Deer A (Adult) - 1.5 years and up J (Juvenile) - 6 months to 1.5years Y (Young of Year) - birth to 6 months Elk A (Adult) - 2.5 years and up S (SubAdult) - 1.5 to 2.5 years J (Juvenile) - 6 months to 1.5 years Y (Young of Year) - birth to 6 months Bio Year Since winter surveys typically span a time period including two years the term BioYear consolidates the survey period into a single year. For example, surveys can start in December 2019 and run through January 2020 so the BioYear for this survey is 2020. The term was created for easier record keeping and does not have a biological definition. The biological year begins on December 15 and was intended to correctly align data collection with biological processes. Estimates from the models operate on this biological year. DAU (Data Analysis Unit) Recent location data from mule deer fitted with GPS radio-collars provided a more informed understanding of how mule deer populations are distributed across Idaho. In light of this new information, IDFG revised the geographical boundaries of the data analysis units (DAU) that are used for mule deer population monitoring and management and incorporated these changes into the IPM. Some aerial surveys can no longer be viewed in the IPM because they don’t include abundance for all of the GMUs in the new DAU. Past aerial surveys were incorporated into the site through a series of conversations with area biologists. Questions about the data can be directed to Paul Atwood or Josh Nowak. "],
["gl-surv.html", "5.2 Survival", " 5.2 Survival Known Fate Survival Model Survival models attempt to estimate the probability that an animal alive at this time will be alive at some future time. A known-fate model does this in part by assuming that the fate of every animal is known. This name was chosen early in the development process. As time has passed we have tweaked and developed the model to relax assumptions and better meet the needs of our collaborators. The full model description is beyond the scope of this Glossary, but know that the Known-Fate model selection means that the results of running a model will show the user estimates of survival and mortality. This is in contrast to the multi-state models where multiple sources of mortality can be estimated, such as death by harvest or death by predator. See also: Multi-state Survival Model Multi-state Survival Model The multi-state survival model allows users to estimate survival, harvest mortality rate and other mortality rate. The different estimates sum to 1 and so to be comparable to the known-fate models users should take 1 - other mortality as equivalent to survival in the known-fate context.

["gl-sight.html", "5.3 Sightability", " 5.3 Sightability Aircraft/Model There are separate elk sightability models depending on the aircraft used for the survey. The aircraft types include a Hiller 12E, Bell 47G, and Super Cub. Mule deer sightability models do not have separate models for different types of aircraft. Area A generic term used to catch the species specific differences in management area naming. Instead of elk zones and deer pmu/dau we simply use area to describe the spatial extent we are focused on for a particular analysis. Composition Survey This survey type is used to gather data related to age and sex ratios and typically samples a smaller portion of the population in an area of interest. See also: Sightability Survey Demographic The demographic field in the sightability output table denotes which age and sex classes are described by the estimated values. Classes are based on on sex and age class and vary by species and survey type. Group size Refers to the number of individuals in a single observed group. The size of the group impacts the probability of detection and influences how the model estimates the true number of individuals. Group sizes include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-15, 16-30, and &gt;30. Movement Categories The 3 movement categories are bedded, standing, and moving. This is based on the most active individual when initially observed. The movement categories impact the probability of detection and influence how the model estimates the true number of individuals. Obs The number of observations in a given strata. Pop The population of sampling units in a given strata. In other words, the total number of subunits in a strata. PropSampled This is the proportion of units sampled in a given strata. This can be calculated by obs/pop, divide the number of subunits sampled in the strata by the total number of subunits in the strata. Sightability Survey An intensive aerial survey methodology to estimate the entire population size in a given area. Data, in the form of raw counts, from this survey are analyzed using a sightability model to estimate true population size from direct counts. See also: Composition Survey Snow The 3 snow cover categories are 0-20%, 21-79%, and &gt;80%. The snow cover categories impact the probability of detection and influences how the model estimates the true number of individuals. Stratum The landscape is divided into separate strata based on the probability of being occupied by the species being surveyed. Typically subunits are classified as high, medium, or low strata based on their suitability as habitat for a particular species. Subunit Used to define the proportion of the unit that was sampled.For example, if a unit consists of 10 subunits and the survey samples 3 of the 10 subunits then 3/10 or .3 of the unit was sampled. This is used to extrapolate sightability estimates such that if this same survey produced a count of 100 then the estimate is 100/.3 or 333 animals in the unit. Unit Synonymous with GMU. Variance The variance components of the sightability output are of interest to the user because they provide clues as to how to improve their surveys. ModelVar: Model variance SampleVar: Sample variance SightVar: Sightability model variance TotalVar: Total variance is the sum of the model, sample,and sightability variances. The square root of the total variance is the standard deviation of the estimated value. Vegetation There are 5 vegetation class categories including grass/open/agriculture, sagebrush, juniper/mtn. mahogany, mtn. brush/aspen, and conifer. Vegetation class represents the dominant vegetation within a 30m buffer around where an individual deer or group of deer is observed. The vegetation class categories impact the probability of detection and influences how the model estimates the true number of individuals. PopR has data columns for all habitat data collected on IDFG elk and mule deer sightability and composition survey forms. IDFG elk aerial survey data sheets contain only % screen and that is the only habitat variable used in the elk sightability model. IDFG mule deer aerial survey and composition data sheets contain data columns for % screen, screen type, and veg type and veg type is the only habitat variable currently used in the mule deer sightability model.

["gl-ipm.html", "5.4 IPM", " 5.4 IPM IPM Database IPM database files contain the estimates from survival and sightability models, and are used when running the IPM. As of September 2020 there are 3 IPM database files in use for IDFG: Atwood.RData – DO NOT USE, this database is for development and research purposes only mule_deer_independent.RData – This database will use survival data from the DAU you are modeling over multiple years when there is not any survival data for the DAU and the year in the database. Use this database if the DAU you are modeling has a large amount of data available and survival is relatively constant between years. mule_deer_shared.RData - Strongly recommended. This database will use survival data from other DAU’s in the state for the current year when there is not any survival data for the DAU and year in the database. Use this database if the DAU you are modeling has little to no data available or if survival is highly variable between years. Future Weather Future weather covariates were developed using Mark Hurley’s dissertation and the analyses contained therein. Average: Mean observed weather conditions Good: Upper 95% quantile of observed weather Bad: Lower 5% quantile of observed weather None: Do not use weather data covariates in the analysis "],
["gl-mcmc.html", "5.5 MCMC", " 5.5 MCMC Automate Convergence Users may choose to simply check the “Automate Convergence” box below the MCMC sliders menu in the PopR interface. This option will assure that an adequate Burn-in Length and number of MCMC Iterations have been used to produce a statistically sound estimate and error distribution. Burnin Length “Burn-in” is a term for an initial process that gives the Markov Chain time to approach the solution to the problem by throwing away some less reasonable starting points at the beginning of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo run. In PopR, managers should simply use the default Burn-in Length setting when developing an estimate through the standard user interface. Iterations PopR uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to “fit” IPM population estimates to the available data. MCMC methods estimate parameters in complex models by systematically updating informed prior distributions with information gleaned from field data (e.g. observed harvest). Therefore, they allow us to describe each parameter in terms of a distribution and that distribution’s shape. Typically, 25,000-100,000 MCMC iterations will be required to fit an IPM. If the number of MCMC iterations is set too low the uncertainty about an estimate is likely to be misrepresented. Brooks-Gelman-Rubin Statistic (R̂) In PopR, we use the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin (BGR) statistic, often represented as R̂ or Rhat, as an assessment of convergence and the criteria used when the “Automate Convergence” option is used. The BGR statistic suggests convergence when estimates of R̂ are below 1.1 or more generally close to 1. This statistic is reported in the output tables for most models and highlighted in red when R̂ estimates are above 1.1. The default settings will produce results that are unlikely to change even if run longer, but users should increase the number of MCMC iterations if R̂ estimates are above 1.1 and computing time allows. Thinning Rate Thinning tells the sampler to only retain every nth value from the chains. This technique is sometimes used to reduce autocorrelation in the chains, but comes at the cost of reduced efficiency of the sampler. A more reasonable use of thinning is when hardware limitations are being reached, which typically comes in the form of running out of memory. This will not be an issue in PopR and, therefore, the recommended setting for the Thinning slider is 1. "]
